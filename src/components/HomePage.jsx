It simulates a simplistic microprogrammed machine (MPM) which can be programmed using primitive microinstructions. The simulator allows users to monitor how each microinstruction affects various registers/memory."

It is the act of creating microprograms which consist of very primitive microinstructions. Microprogramming is typically used to implement machine instructions instead of implementing them with complex circuitry. It also enables engineers to implement a machineâ€™s instruction set differently with varying efficiencies and costs."
